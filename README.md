# TrollMe.sh ðŸ§Œ

Welcome to TrollMe.sh, a fun and harmless way to play some jokes on your friends (because I know your family doesn't use the shell) when they leave their computer unattended. 

## What is TrollMe.sh?

TrollMe.sh is a website that allows you to install friendly and removable scripts on your friends' computers. These scripts perform amusing actions to surprise them. Simply run the following command on their terminal:

```sh
curl -s https://get.trollme.sh | sh -s -- "A friend"
```

## What Does It Do?

The script installs a variety of harmless joke scripts on the computer. Here are a few examples:

- **Messing with Bash Aliases**: Change common commands to do unexpected things.
- **Sudo Denial**: Display a message like "Iâ€™m sorry $USER, Iâ€™m afraid I canâ€™t do that" instead of allowing the user to execute commands with sudo.
- **Strange Sounds**: Play odd sounds randomly in the background.
- **Fake Login Prompt**: Present a fake login prompt when opening a new terminal window.

## Adding Your Own Scripts

It's easy to add more jokes. Just write a small script and commit it to the `shellscripts/actions` folder. This keeps the fun going and allows for a variety of jokes.

## Installation with Identification

When installing the script, include your name to identify yourself. This adds to the fun and assures your friend that their computer has not been compromised. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

```sh
curl -s https://get.trollme.sh | sh -s -- "A friend"
```

## Removal

Don't worry, everything is easy to remove. The script comes with an uninstall script that will clean up all the installed joke scripts.

```sh
~/.local/share/trollme.sh/uninstall.sh
```

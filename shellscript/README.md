# You have pranked by: *$SOURCE_NAMED* on *$INSTALL_DATE*
The person installed this script from $WEBSITE_URL to prank you.
You can remove it by running the following command:

    bash $FOLDER_LOCATION/uninstall.sh

The uninstall script will remove the folder \`$FOLDER_LOCATION\` as well as a few lines in your \`~/.profile\` if possible. 
If it cannot remove the required lines from your \`~/.profile\` file you will have to do it manually. You should open it and look for these lines. If you for any reason cannot find them or remove them you should know that they are harmless and wont do anything as long as you remove this folder
